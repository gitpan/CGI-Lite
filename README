Note from the CPAN administration: The CGI::Lite module seems to be
abandoned by its original author. We cannot contact him anymore. The
2.0 release has been made on 2000-08-20. This 2.001 release is just an
emergency release that fixes the most urgent security need. It is not
endorsed by the original author. It was put together by me after the
advisory http://msgs.securepoint.com/cgi-bin/get/bugtraq0302/94.html
on the bugtraq mailing list. Thanks to Ronald F. Guilmette for
bringing up this issue.

I do not and will not maintain CGI::Lite and would welcome volunteers
to take it over.

CGI::Lite v2.0
--------------

You can use this module to decode form and query information, including
file uploads, as well as cookies in a very simple manner; you need not
concern yourself with the actual details behind the decoding process.

Here are the changes for this version:

Name change: the module once known as CGI_Lite is now CGI::Lite.


Here are the changes for previous versions:

1.9
In order to use CGI_Lite in a persistant application (e.g. using FCGI
or mod_perl), each new request must be parsed afresh - that is, the CGI
object's state needs to be reset for each request. The new function
parse_new_form_data() clears the CGI object's state before calling
parse_form_data().

e.g.

	use FCGI;
        use CGI_Lite;

	$cgi = new CGI_Lite;

	while(FCGI::accept() >= 0)
        {
	    $form = $cgi->parse_new_form_data;

	    print("Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n");

	    $cgi->print_data;
        }
