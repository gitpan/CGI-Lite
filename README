Released: 13th Jun 2014


DESCRIPTION
-----------

You can use this module to decode form and query information, including file
uploads, as well as cookies in a very simple manner; you need not concern
yourself with the actual details behind the decoding process.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

This is a developer release. Some of the upload tests were failling for
Microsoft users and the test suite has been modified as a result.

The documentation has also seen minor updates to reflect the change of
maintainer.
