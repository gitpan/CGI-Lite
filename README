CGI::Lite v2.03_02
----------------

Released: 17th Jun 2014


DESCRIPTION
-----------

You can use this module to decode form and query information, including file
uploads, as well as cookies in a very simple manner; you need not concern
yourself with the actual details behind the decoding process.


NEW IN THIS VERSION
-------------------

This is a developer release. Some of the upload tests were failling
for Microsoft users and the test suite and the module itself have been
modified as a result.

See the CHANGES file for full history.
